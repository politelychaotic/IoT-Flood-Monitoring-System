# IoT-Flood-Monitoring-System
`iot_flood_monitoring_system_part_1.ino` is code for an Arduino Uno to control simple IoT Flood Monitoring system that collects distance data from a Ultrasonic sensor that uses a Threshold to determine whether or not there is flooding present.  
`flood_level.m` is MatLab code to speak to ThingSpeak, plot the data points from the Arduino data, and turn on and off indicator lights on ThingSpeak as well as create a number indicator of the current water level and a time plot of the water level.
